void main()
{
	'\t';
}

// Though \t is composed of two characters
// viz. '\' and 't', C/C++ still treats as
// a character constant.
// There are few more combinations like \t.
// For ex. \a (audiable bell)
// \b (backspace)
// \f (formfeed)
// \n (new line)
// \r (carriage return)
// \t (tab)
// \v (vertical tab)
// Above character constants are commonly known
// as escape sequences.
